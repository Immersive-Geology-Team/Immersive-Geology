Note from IG Developers
Muddykat, UnSchtalch and Kuruma
IG version 1.1 is still in development, it's a very ambitious mod, and as such will take a LONG time to update to future versions of minecraft, I'd like to ask our players to be patient for the 1.18.2+ versions of IG, or the development of other IE Addons by the Immersive Team. ~Muddykat
We HIGHLY recommend installing JEI to help with recipes, the manual has a decent amount of information, but we have missed things.
