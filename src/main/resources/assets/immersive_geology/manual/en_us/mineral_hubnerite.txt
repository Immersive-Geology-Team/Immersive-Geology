Hubnerite
Minerals
<&hubnerite>
is a mineral consisting of manganese tungsten oxide (MnWO4).
It is used as a source of Tungsten. However it needs to be processed first.

Using a method to <link;crusher;crush;start> the mineral will give some dirty crushed hubnerite 
Putting it through a <link;immersive_geology:gravityseparator;Gravity;start> or industrial seperator will yield crushed hubnerite

Processing Hubnernite into Tungsten Ingots is difficult due to it's high melting point.
So the eaiser method is to use a <link;blast_furnace;blast furnace;start> and get some Tungesten Grit.
<&grit_tungsten>
If you have access to a <link;arc_furnace;Arc Furnace;start> you can produce tungsten ingots from either grit or crushed hubnerite. 
The grit can be used to create some very strong metal alloys.

No current use, will be used for late game machines!
please note that the real process generally doesn't use an arc furnace as most arc furnaces reach 1800C, while laboratory units run around 3000C but can exceed said temperature. (Tungsten Melting point is 3422C)
